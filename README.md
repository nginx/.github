# Default Community Health Files

This repository holds the default GitHub community health files for the `nginx` GitHub organization.

"Community Health Files" is a GitHub term referring to
[a series of community files](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types) that are deemed essential for a thriving open source project.

By creating a series of default community health files in a given organization's `.github` repository, GitHub populates any given organization repository with these files if they are not already present in the aforementioned repository.
